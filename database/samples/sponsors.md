## **Showcase Your Organization to Regional Talent**

<br><br>
Human capital is an essential resource for todayâ€™s innovation and knowledge-based economy. Many organizations struggle to find and retain highly educated and skilled staff members, especially in technolgoy roles. The BaselHack 2022 is an ideal platform to showcase your organization. At the BaselHack people from different backgrounds, expertise, topics, viewpoints and organizations come together to test ideas, create new concepts and build solution prototypes within one weekend. As such, we bring together highly motivated people who care about their social impact and the solutions they build. Become a sponsor to meet people with a diverse set of skills who can help you and your organization to thrive.
