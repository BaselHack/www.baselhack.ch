## Why we want to partner with you?
The competitive power of a region is based on the creativity of its people and organizations. Many regions struggle to retain or attract the highly educated and skilled workforce. BaselHack is a platform where people from different backgrounds, expertise, topics, viewpoints and organizations come together to create new concepts and build solutions. Every city needs such a melting pot. We want to partner with you because this is not a one-time task you can check off your list. It is a continuous engagement building an attractive place to live for everyone, just like in a relationship. Everyone contributes in building something big. We want us to come together so that BaselHack grows roots in the minds and hearts of everyone in the Basel region. We partner with organizations, government institutions and education to grow BaselHack into an institution that we cannot imagine to be without.
