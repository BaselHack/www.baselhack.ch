BaselHack is the hackathon for Basel, Northwestern Switzerland and bordering Alsace and SÃ¼dbaden. The BaselHack hackathon has been held annually since 2017. Young and young-at-heart developers, technology fanatics, designers and other interested persons meet in every autumn and spend a weekend tinkering, developing and coding various ideas.

The goal of the hackathon is to get from an idea or a concrete problem to a first, functional prototype (software or hardware) in just a few hours. At the end of the hackathon weekend, the teams - which have often only formed at the beginning of the hackathon - present their prototypes. A technically experienced jury looks at the presentations and prototypes and scores the projects based on several criteria.
