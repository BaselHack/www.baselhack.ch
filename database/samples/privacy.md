# SSL encryption
This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as
requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the
address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL
encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
